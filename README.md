# udacity-nanodegree-feedreader
Feedreader with Jasmine tests

## Tests
- Test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty

- Test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty

- Test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default

- Test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display itself when clicked, and does it hide when clicked again?

- Test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container

- Test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes
How is this test different from the previous test?
